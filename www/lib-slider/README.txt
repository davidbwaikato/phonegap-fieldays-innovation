Based on
http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/examples/swipe/swipe-page.html

Google Chrome requires you to run it in a mode that gives access to local files, or else to run it from a web server:

without doing so, the pages don't do the swipe/slide transition in the Google Chrome browser and the console displays the error:
"XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/Anupama/tipple-phonegap/phonegap-fieldays-innovation/www/innovation-story-01-res.html. Received an invalid response. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access."
