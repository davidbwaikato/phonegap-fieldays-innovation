		<h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
			<p>Tony didn’t live to see his kennel go into production, but his granddaughter Rosie Todhunter has taken up the challenge. Today she is working with specialist manufacturers to develop a cost effective version of the Thermo Kennel. “My grandfather didn’t concern himself about the economics of his inventions, he just wanted to make life better for farmers and basically to give away his inventions to his mates.”</p>
