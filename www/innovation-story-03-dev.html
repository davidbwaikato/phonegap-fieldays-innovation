			Unfortunately Tony didn’t live to see his kennel go into production but his grand daughter Rosie Todhunter has taken up the challenge. Together with Gavin Ness of Fipul, a specialist manufacturer of fibreglass and plastic-injected moulded products they have been developing a cost version of the Thermo Kennel that can be marketed in New Zealand and overseas. “My grandfather didn’t concern himself about the economics of his inventions he just wanted to make life better for farmers and basically give away his inventions to his mates”
