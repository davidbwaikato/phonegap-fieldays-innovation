Pure Wild Ginseng

-- Glen Katu and his team

The people of Maraeroa were looking for a
companion crop to grow within their pine forest.

IDEA

The problem was what could grow in the pumice and ash soil and in the shade of the forest canopy? It was suggested they try ginseng, a plant best known in Asia where wild ginseng is prized for its medicinal qualities. Glen Katu and his team found little was known about growing the plant in the wild here. 

RESEARCH

With the help of Crop & Food, a trial planting in 2006 proved that the region’s dry summers, cold winters and free draining soils were ideal for ginseng. Further research into who might buy the ginseng showed the best prices were paid for naturally growing ginseng, in other words ginseng that looks, tastes and smells like wild ginseng plus was free of chemicals and high in the ginsenoside active ingredient. 

TESTING

In 2009 an initial commercial crop was planted based on the knowledge gleaned from the previous 3 years of ginseng trials. The team installed rabbit-proof fences and nets to protect the crop from the birds. They also learnt a new lesson when slugs invaded the plantation in the spring when the first new shoots appeared. The crop survived the ordeal but a whole season's growing time was lost. 

DEVELOPMENT

There were many questions about the Chinese market. Helped by their Chinese contacts, the team visited the traditional growing areas of Northern China. They learnt how to maximise each wild ginseng plant's value including how to wash, dry and present it. The ginseng experts in Fusong also explained why ginseng grew faster in New Zealand than in traditional areas of Northern China. 

SOLUTION

Today New Zealand Pure Wild Ginseng is being harvested. Extensive research has established other suitable growing environments across the central North Island. Maraeroa is providing seedlings and guidance for future high quality crops for this new industry. This has been a journey of questioning and forging new relationships to create a knowledge and skill base to build a prosperous future.

The Bot

-- Linda Bulk and Robert Brouwer

“Every idea starts with a problem. Linda and I were doing commercial photography and dreamt about getting an image from the sky without the cost of a helicopter.”

IDEA

“I had always been fascinated by flight and radio controlled planes and one day we saw a very crude remote controlled model with a camera attached. It didn’t really do the job but we knew if the technology could be sorted this could be the answer.” 

RESEARCH

“We looked around and saw that while some of the solution was there - engines, propellers, electronics - the big issue was the airframe itself.

It had to be strong enough to carry the camera but the vibration travelling through it meant you couldn’t get stable quality pictures. We needed an airframe that would eliminate the vibration.”


TESTING

“We started making prototypes with carbon fibre cloth and different resins.

It took 8 months but we developed a structure that took crystal clear images every time! We posted footage on just one forum and the interest was intense, everyone wanted one.”


DEVELOPMENT

“The first units were all handmade and took months to make.

The learning curve was moving to a machine-made model that could be mass-produced and yet still retain the qualities of the handmade version. We thought we might sell one or two a week but within 3 months of our website going up we had orders for hundreds.”

SOLUTION

“Today our advanced multi-rotor airframes work around the globe wherever there is a need for aerial robotic photography and it’s all because of the ingenuity of our people, the problem-solving team behind these amazing machines.” 



“For me, it’s like a rock band. A single musician on their own can be something good, but sometimes a group comes together where everything lines up - complementary skills, harmony and unified intention - then something extraordinary happens; a creative powerhouse emerges. Linda and I brought out the best in one another and everyone who has come on board has added to that.”

Thermo Kennel

-- Tony Prentice

“Good things take time” according to those in the south. The idea for 80-year-old Tony Prentice’s
Thermo Kennel first occurred to him in 2003.

IDEA

Tony, a retired Canterbury sheep farmer, had seen dogs housed in some pretty miserable conditions during his high country days and he knew there had to be better ways to look after valuable working dogs. Tony knew that a warmer kennel wasn’t just about comfort, warm dogs eat less and they work longer. The kennel also needed to be light so it could be transported easily and it couldn’t be too expensive. 

RESEARCH

After dogs ate his first plywood prototype, Tony hit on the idea of using recycled plastic 44 gallon drums. By fitting one inside the other there could be a layer of insulation between. Dog kennels generally have open doors “often facing the wind”. What was needed was a durable “curtain” that dogs could pass through. A loose fitting “floor” was added, easy to remove for cleaning.

TESTING

Using polystyrene as an insulator and a polycarbonate curtain at the entrance meant the dog’s own body heat raised the kennel’s temperature. “Blankets don’t give you any heat. They just act as insulators. You provide the heat. It’s the same here. The dog provides the heat, the kennel just insulates it.” Tests showed the temperature inside the Thermo Kennel was at least 10 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. 

DEVELOPMENT

Tony didn’t live to see his kennel go into production, but his granddaughter Rosie Todhunter has taken up the challenge. Today she is working with specialist manufacturers to develop a cost effective version of the Thermo Kennel. “My grandfather didn’t concern himself about the economics of his inventions, he just wanted to make life better for farmers and basically to give away his inventions to his mates.”

SOLUTION

Rosie is re-launching the Thermo Kennel at the Mystery Creek Fieldays. If she succeeds, Tony’s vision of every working dog having a hygienic, warm and durable kennel will be realised. Her message to dog owners - in the words of the late Tony Prentice – “don’t give your dog a bone, give him a decent home!”

Kindling Cracker


This is Ayla Hutchinson. Last year she won the Fieldays’ Young Inventor of the Year Award for her Kindling Cracker.


IDEA


“I needed something for my school science project and then Mum had an accident chopping kindling. I thought here’s a problem we need to find a solution for - how do you make chopping kindling safer?”

RESEARCH

“I went on the web looking to see what others had done but I couldn’t find anything. Then I thought, what if instead of the axe coming down on the wood you brought the wood down on the blade? I found an old axe head and Dad helped me weld it to a flat plate. It worked. If you banged the wood with a hammer it split cleanly in two.”

TESTING

“I had a prototype but a blade sticking straight up was still dangerous. The top safety ring was added so no-one could fall onto the blade and impale themselves on it. It also ensured hands couldn’t come near the blade when in use. I entered the Fieldays Innovation Awards and the response was huge, we got a lot of feedback and filled an exercise book with orders.”


DEVELOPMENT

“It wasn’t just our family involved anymore, I talked to experts about how to strengthen steel and manufacturers about molds and how to cast the parts. Based on feedback we modified the blade and made the surround just one piece of metal so it couldn’t break. I talked to lawyers about how to protect the idea and planned how to package and market my Kindling Cracker.” 


SOLUTION

“Kindling Cracker is in production and selling through the website kindlingcracker.com. The journey doesn’t end here, it’s just beginning. Everyone in the world needs to know there is a way they can cut kindling without hurting themselves! I know now a good idea is the easy part, you have to keep working it, testing it, and whatever happens, don’t give up!”
